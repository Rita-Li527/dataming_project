## Research Questions
 1. For the selected routes between LAS and LAX, what will be the reason that caused different types of delay?

 2. Could we create models to predict the delay?

## Data Sets
For flight data, we filter the original monthly data to the flights between LAX and LAS airport and select the first 70 columns. Then we combined all the monthly data together to the following datasets:

`flights1819.csv`: flights data from June 2018 to December 2021

`flight2021.csv`: flights data from Jan 2021 to Dec 2021

`flights2223.csv`: flights data from January 2022 to May 2023
